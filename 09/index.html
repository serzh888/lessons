            <p class="pt">
                Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                instructions, they've moved to <span> their own section</span>. Continue reading for an introduction to
                the
                documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

            <h2>core components</h2>
            <p class="arro">Chapter 2</p>

            <p class="pt"> React Native runs on <span> React</span> , a popular open source library for building
                user interfaces with
                JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
                get you started or can serve as a refresher </p>

            <p class="pt">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

            <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>

            <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                write elements inside
                JavaScript like so: <span> Hello, I am your cat!</span> .</p>

            <p class="pt">The React docs have <span> a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even
                more. Because
                JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name,
                and embedding it with curly braces inside </p>

            <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ props. </span>Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>

            <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ state.</span>While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                configure how components
                render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

            <h2>HANDLINE TEXT INPUT</h2>
            <p class="arro">Chapter 4</p>

            <p class="pt">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop
                that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

            <p class="pt">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
                there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
