                    Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                    instructions, they've moved to <u> their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to
                    the
                    documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

                <p class="pt">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                    React
                    and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                    platform‚Äôs
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
                        class="itl"> bundles of
                        reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
                    let‚Äôs cover how
                    components work in React Native.

            <div id="REACTFUNDAMENTAILS" class="container2 padd">
                <div class="line"></div>
                <h2>REACT FUNDAMENTAILS</h2>
                <p class="arro">Chapter 3</p>

                <p class="pt"> React Native runs on <u>React</u> , a popular open source library for building
                    user interfaces with
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
                    get you started or can serve as a refresher </p>

                <p class="pt">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

                <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                    in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>

                <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                    write elements inside
                    JavaScript like so: <span class="spamcolor">&lt;Text&gt Hello, I am your cat!&lt;Text&gt</span> .
                </p>

                <p class="pt">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even
                    more. Because
                    JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                        class="spamcolor">
                        name </span>for the cat, name,
                    and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="spamcolor">&lt;Text&gt; </span> </p>

                <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ props. </span>Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>

                <p class="pt"> <span class="ptt">+ state.</span>While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                    configure how components
                    render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                    changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

            </div>
            <div id="HANDLINETEXTINPUT" class="container2 padd">
                <div class="line"></div>
                <h2>HANDLINE TEXT INPUT</h2>
                <p class="arro">Chapter 4</p>

                <p class="pt">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                        class="itl"> onChangeText </span>prop
                    that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                    takes a
                    function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

                <p class="pt">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                    different
                    language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                    "Hello
                    there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
